# Vafor Games ig
A simple gaming site I made for fun because I couldn't find any good ones. It got me called to the vice principal's office, lmao.

This is a work in progress, so expect some bugs and broken features. I'm the only dev so expect stuff to be broken all the time. 

## Upcoming and Current Features
* **Tab cloak:** Disguises the site as something else to hide it.
* **About blank opening:** Opens the game in a new, clean tab.
* **Save/restore data:** A feature to save all local storage and cookies to a file and re-upload them.
